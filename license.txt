This program now requires FreeImage.DLL in order to load extra image types.
As required by the FreeImage Public License:
If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then you must include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory file) where a user would be likely to look for such a notice. (such as this license file)
"The contents of this file are subject to the FreeImage Public License Version 1.0 (the "License"); you may not use this file except in compliance with the License. You may obtain a copy of the License at http://home.wxs.nl/~flvdberg/freeimage-license.txt

No modifications were made to the freeimage.dll file, or internal freeimage source code, so that covers our use of the dll in a free capacity.
