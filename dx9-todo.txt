Things which have to be done before the official DX9 release:

*) fix text reels
*) fix text decals
*) fix kickers cutting the ball in half
*) add video option for "Max prerendered frames" (currently hardcoded to 2, see m_limiter in player.cpp; best to default to 2)
*) add checkbox to use software vertex processing (fixes rendering on some Intel chipsets)
*) disable MSAA until we fix the flickering
*) improve GUI for vsync/frame limiting (very unintuitive right now)
*) remove true fullscreen options completely?
*) nice to have: multi-monitor support; but probably later
