DX9 renderer known issues:

*) lights set to blinking don't work
*) textboxes don't work
*) EM reels only work in Image Reel mode, not Text Reel
*) text decals don't work
*) kickers don't respect the depth buffer correctly
*) Stereo 3D disabled
*) AA disabled
*) renderer uses non-power-of-two textures, may cause troubles on some older cards
*) full screen mode doesn't work with VPM. Workaround: set "ddraw" to 0 in the VPM settings (though DMD doesn't seem to show)
*) textures aren't preloaded, can lead to stutter in some cases
*) lost devices aren't handled properly
*) screen shake doesn't work
*) object draw order wrong (see e.g.: 8BD, bonus targets under alpha ramp)
